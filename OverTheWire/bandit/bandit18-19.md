Bandit Level 18 â†’ Level 19
==========================

Level Goal
----------

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------

ssh, ls, cat


Solution
========

We just have to let the ssh command execute 'cat readme' for us before we get thrown out of the ssh session:

```
gengelke@genmac ~ $ ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
 _                     _ _ _
