Solution
========

The text gives us the hint that the content of file data.txt is encoded with the ROT13 algorithm. ROT13 is described in detail in the mentioned Wikipedia article.
Once again I strongly recommend to read and understand the article carefully because again you will have to deal with ROT13 encoded data in other CTF and/or wargame challenges relatively often.
Furthermore the article tells us how to decrypt the password:

```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```
