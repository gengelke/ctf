Bandit Level 13 → Level 14
==========================

Level Goal
----------

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

Solution
========

As described in the text the directory contains a private key for SSH:

```
bandit13@bandit:~$ cat sshkey.private

```

Furthermore the text mentioned "localhost" so let's try to login to localhost using username bandit14 and the private SSH key:

```
bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is ee:4c:8c:e7:57:2c:bc:63:24:b8:e6:23:27:63:72:9f.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

Welcome to the OverTheWire games machine!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven on
irc.overthewire.org.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine holds several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother.

  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda) in /usr/local/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) in /usr/local/pwntools/
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/) should be in $PATH

--[ More information ]--

Great. So let's get the password:

```

bandit14@bandit:~$ cat  /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

```
