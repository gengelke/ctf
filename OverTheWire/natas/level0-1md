Natas Level 0 → Level 1
=======================

Username: natas1
URL:      http://natas1.natas.labs.overthewire.org


Solution
========

Browse to the URL and login with username ```natas1``` and the password you gained in level0.
You'll see the following message:

```
You can find the password for the next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked! 
```

Not sure if it's an error or if I alrady have deactivated JavaScript but when I right-clicked once again and selected "View Page Source" I once again for the next level's password very easily:

```
<html>
<head>
<!-- This stuff in the header has nothing to do with the level -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://natas.labs.overthewire.org/css/level.css">

<script>var wechallinfo = { "level": "natas1", "pass": "gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto" };</script></head>
<body oncontextmenu="javascript:alert('right clicking has been blocked!');return false;">
<h1>natas1</h1>
<div id="content">

next level on this page, but rightclicking has been blocked!

<!--The password for natas2 is ZluruAthQk7Q2MqmDeTiUij2ZvWy2mBi -->
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

If it doesn't work for you, you'll have to deactivate JavaScript in your browser's preferences and reload the page. Then you'll be able to right-click as well.
