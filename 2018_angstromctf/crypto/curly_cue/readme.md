crypto, 110

I made a new writing system. It is beautiful. Here are some pictures I took of it: (1, 2, 3, [4]/static/crypto/curlycue/Page4.jpg). Also here is the flag. The flag is all one word and not in the actf{} format.

HINT:
This is a substitution cipher with letters modified based on the letters before and after them. Things that look like punctuation probably are. There are no upper or lower cases. The pages are from a famous book. There may be spelling mistakes (handwriting is unreliable).
